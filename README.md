This is a project for creating a tracing tool which can trace TLM/SystemC transactions.
These are the goals I have in mind for this tool.
1. To be able to trace minimum/One time change needed to be done in Codebase.
2. To have a better and user friendly GUI as well as command line option(probably something similar to GDB).
